# Interpreting-and-Checking-Tool
The EFSAâ€™s Interpreting and checking tool (ICT), is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program which aim to translate and check the correctness of FoodEx2 codes. The tool is provided with different business rules and macros which allow to automatically interpret FoodEx2 codes.

The tool is an add-on of the Catalogue browser which, for this reason, should be installed in order to correctly use the ICT.
